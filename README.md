# DeFi__UniswapV3Simulator
This project is loosely based on UniswapV3 architecture with a live algorithm and statistic process.

In this project, we will use the following:
- Foundry Framework
- UniswapV3 architecture
- Streamlit to indicate the statistics
- ZK rollups as network deployment
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc, for statistics
- OpenzeZeppelin contracts
- Slither and Aderyn as static tools
- Echidna for fuzz testing
